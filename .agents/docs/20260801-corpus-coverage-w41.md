# W41 Linux corpus coverage record

## Scope

This checkpoint continues PR #36 against `rewrite_bun_in_mcpp`. It uses exact
failure-file lists, bounded runners, and one coordinator build. It does not
claim a new full-corpus score.

## Baseline and planner

| corpus | full baseline | actionable files |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Node | 3134/4433 green (70.7%) | 425 |
| Bun | 1015/1902 green (53.4%) | 170 |

Commit `00b1fcc` makes throughput totals ignore rows whose `minutes` or
`delivered` fields are `PENDING`. The fixture now fails before the fix and the
planner self-test passes after it. The resource guard planned five lanes under
the observed Linux limits; the coordinator owns the only root build.

## Probe ledger

| wave | lane | selected files | result | strategy |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Node crypto | 24 | 0 green, 24 fail | park; native/PQC/FIPS/Argon2 walls |
| 1 | Node VM | 19 | 0 green, 19 fail | retain only isolated candidates |
| 1 | Node WebCrypto | 19 | 0 green, 19 fail | park; unsupported algorithms and WebIDL gaps |
| 1 | Bun third-party | 25 | 0 green, 1280 pass / 134 fail assertions | park; optional native/TLS/external runtime |
| 1 | Bun CLI/run | 17 | 0 green, 19 pass / 258 fail assertions | park; package/FUSE/bun:bundle gaps |
| 2 | Node test-runner | 30 | 0 green, 30 fail | keep; snapshot surface is the clearest seam |
| 2 | Node test-util | 12 | 0 green, 12 fail | keep only low-risk isolated APIs |
| 2 | Node test-v8 | 11 | 0 green, 11 fail | park; profiler/queryObjects/startup snapshot ownership |

## Delivered slice

The frozen binary reported `test-runner-string-to-regexp.js` as `fail`; the
coordinator binary built with GCC16 reports `pass`. The fix wraps the native
RegExp constructor only to restore Node's invalid-flags diagnostic and repairs
the observable prototype constructor identity. It does not alter successful
RegExp matching or construction.

Evidence:

- `bash tools/integration/build_or_die.sh` — coordinator build passed.
- `python3 tools/integration/node_corpus_runner.py --bin <coordinator-bin> --files <file-list> ...`
  — target file **1/1 pass**.
- Direct smoke — function call, `new`, `instanceof`, constructor identity, and
  invalid-flags error text all passed.
- Regression comparison — `test-runner-option-validation.js` frozen/new both
  **1/1**; `test-util-inspect-regexp.js` and `test-util-inspect.js` frozen/new
  both **0/2**, so those pre-existing inspect failures were not counted as
  regressions.

The next coordinator build also repaired one isolated `util.promisify` contract:

- `internal/util`'s private `customPromisifyArgs` identity is normalized at the
  loader boundary; the public bootstrap implementation now maps multiple
  callback values to the named object.
- Direct smoke with a function decorated by the internal symbol produced
  `{"first":5,"second":17}`.
- `test-fs-readv-promisify.js` is **1/1 pass** after the build.
- `test-util-promisify.js` remains **0/1 file green** because two independent
  warning-contract checks still fail; its custom-args assertion no longer fails.
- The fresh build kept `test-runner-option-validation.js` and
  `test-runner-string-to-regexp.js` at **1/1** each.

The following runner slice wires the existing vendored `SnapshotManager` into
the standalone TestContext:

- `t.assert.snapshot()` and `t.assert.fileSnapshot()` now use one per-process
  manager, including update/read mode and exit-time writes.
- `node:test.snapshot.setResolveSnapshotPath()` and
  `setDefaultSnapshotSerializers()` are exposed.
- `test-runner-snapshot-file-tests.js` is **1/1 pass**; its validation and
  update/read flows pass.
- The multi-file `--test --test-isolation=none` path now works from an arbitrary
  temporary cwd: an update/read round reaches **6/6 pass** for both fixture
  files. The fix discovers the vendored Node `lib` root from the entry file for
  `internal/*` requests and temporarily anchors the snapshot loader during its
  one-time builtin-map initialization.
- Serial `test-runner-snapshot-tests.js` now reaches **33/33 subtests pass**.
  The TAP reporter includes the failed assertion's structured error message, so
  the child negative case observes `Missing snapshots` as Node does. A five-lane
  concurrent probe also hit a shared child-shim `ENOENT`; the serial rerun is
  the authoritative measurement and the shim race is not counted as a runtime
  regression.
- `test-runner-assert.js` now passes the `t.assert` method enumeration and fails
  only on source-expression stack enrichment. No no-op snapshot methods were
  added.

## Next route

1. Revisit the remaining test-util warning contract separately; do not combine it
   with the completed multi-value promisify slice.
2. Keep assertion source positions as a separate runtime lane because the
   missing data originates at the JSC internal-binding boundary.
3. Keep test-v8 profiler/queryObjects and broad VM wording changes parked until
   ownership is clear.

copied logs; use placeholders when examples need them.

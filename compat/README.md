# Compatibility corpora

`compat/` is the single home for upstream compatibility inputs, runners, and
their recorded measurements.

## Layout

- `bun/` is the `oven-sh/bun` submodule, currently pinned to a `main` snapshot.
- `bun/test/` contains Bun's native test corpus.
- `compat/bun/bench/` contains Bun's native benchmark corpus.
- `node/` is the `nodejs/node` submodule, pinned to the selected Node.js release.
- `node/test/` contains Node's native test corpus.
- `data/` contains corpus inventories and benchmark result data.

Initialize the upstream repositories with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The submodules are read-only inputs. mbun-specific adapters, fixtures, and
harnesses belong outside them.

## Bun corpus runner

```bash
MBUN="$(find target -type f -name mbun -perm -111 | head -n 1)"
python3 tools/integration/bun_corpus_runner.py \
  --bin "$MBUN" --cwd compat/bun \
  --discover compat/bun/test --sample-per-group 100000 \
  --out target/integration/bun-corpus --jobs 14 --timeout 30
```

`--cwd compat/bun` matters: bun's own CI runs from the bun repo root, so tests
that spawn relative fixture paths and the corpus `bunfig.toml` only work there.
`summary.json` reports per-file classifications; `green` counts files whose
every executed test passed (skipped-only files are their own bucket).

## Node corpus runner

Node's upstream `test/parallel` files are plain scripts that expect exit
code 0 (no test runner). The runner executes each file directly through mbun;
harness services Node's own runner would provide (`// Flags:` comments,
internal bindings, env setup) are NOT emulated, so files that need them count
as failures. The result is honest file-level coverage, not an API checklist.

```bash
python3 tools/integration/node_corpus_runner.py \
  --bin "$MBUN" \
  --out target/integration/node-parallel --jobs 14 --timeout 15
```

Measurement data is stored under [`compat/data/`](data/), including test and
benchmark inventories and native run results.
